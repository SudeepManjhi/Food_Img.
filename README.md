# Food_Img.
Project Description:
This project aims to build an image classification model using the Food-101 dataset, which contains 101 categories of food images. We utilize TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets to streamline data handling and model training. The project follows a step-by-step pipeline involving data preprocessing, model building using Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2), training, evaluation, prediction, and optional model saving.
